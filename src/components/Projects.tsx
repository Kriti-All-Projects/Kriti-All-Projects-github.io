      title: 'Three Phase Inverter',
      description: 'This project is a three-phase inverter system that uses IGBTs and an Arduino for control. It takes a three-phase AC input, which is first converted into DC using a three-phase rectifier. The resulting DC is then fed into a three-phase inverter built with IGBTs to generate a controlled AC output. An Arduino is programmed to generate the gate signals required to switch the IGBTs and control the inverter operation. The system includes four push buttons connected to the Arduino: one for starting the inverter, one for stopping it, and two for adjusting the output frequency (increase and decrease). This setup allows basic control over the inverter\'s output, making it suitable for applications like variable frequency drives or motor control.',

      title: 'Audio Analyzer',
      description: 'This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller and an INMP441 microphone to capture and analyze audio signals, displaying the results on an OLED screen. It calculates the sound level in decibels, determines the fundamental frequency, and analyzes additional parameters like time period and magnitude. A button allows users to switch between three views on the OLED display: decibel levels, frequency, and a list of other parameters. The system is designed for real-time audio analysis, making it versatile for sound monitoring and educational purposes.',

      title: 'Smart Light Switch',
      description: 'The Smart Light Switch using Arduino allows both manual and automatic control of brightness. In manual mode, a potentiometer adjusts the brightness, and a switch turns the light on or off. In automatic mode, a light sensor (BH1750) detects ambient brightness and adjusts the light intensity accordingly, while two ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) detect human presence to turn the light on or off. A toggle switch allows switching between these modes. The system uses TRIAC to control the light output, making it an efficient and smart lighting solution.',

      title: 'Line Following Robot',
      description: 'I have participated in numerous Line Follower Robot competitions, where the challenge is to build a robot that follows a black line to the finish point as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and penalties for going off-track. My robot is a two-wheel car powered by an Arduino Nano and sensors. Although I didn\'t win most of the competitions, I did achieve 2nd runner-up in one of them. I\'ve documented each experience with videos and enjoyed every moment of these events.',
